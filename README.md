# Devide-and-conquer
- Divide and conquer is:</br>
1) divide: This involves dividing the problem into smaller sub-problems.</br>
2) conquer: Solve sub-problems by calling recursivly until solved.</br>
3) combine: combine the sub-problems to get the finel solution of the whole problem.</br>

# Merge-sort

Is a sorting algorithm. The algorithm divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and finally merges the two sorted halves. </br>

- Time complexity of this programme is: O(nlog(n))
- Space comlexity: O(1) ( I sort the array in the same array)

# Quick-sort 

Is a sorting algorithm. The algorithm picks a pivot element and rearranges the array elements so that all elements smaller than the picked pivot element move to the left side of the pivot, and all greater elements move to the right side. Finally, the algorithm recursively sorts the subarrays on the left and right of the pivot element. </br>
